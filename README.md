Just want the current codes? [Check out the CSV file in this repo](https://github.com/VinceCarbone/Borderlands4-SHiFTCodes/blob/main/Borderlands4%20SHiFT%20Codes.csv)
<br><br>
You can also download the script and run it locally in PowerShell

This script will scrape the interweb for SHiFT codes. It checks a few different sites and combines the results. It'll sort the output by expiration date and filter out expired codes as well.

## Parameters
```-ExportCSV```
<br>This will export a CSV of the currently valid SHiFT codes to the current working directory

```-git```
<br>This is simply so my scheduled task will merge any CSV changes with the repo automatically. You probably don't need to worry about this one.
